## Question 1

**What are the parameters that affect Energy Use Intensity (EUI)?**

**Options:**
- Climate Zone  
- Annual Energy Use  
- Annual Daylight Intensity  
- Building Area  
- Building Typology  

**Choices:**
1. 1, 2, 4, 5  
2. 1, 2, 3, 4  
3. 2, 3, 4, 5  
4. 2, 4, 5, 3

**Solution:**  
EUI is defined as the annual energy use divided by the building area. In addition, the energy performance is influenced by the location (climate zone) and the building typology. Annual Daylight Intensity is not typically a factor.

## Question 2

**Cut-in speed is the minimum speed required to move a wind turbine. Select the correct option with respect to Cut-in speed.**

**Options:**
- Cut-in speed for horizontal axis wind turbine is higher than vertical axis wind turbine  
- Cut-in speed for vertical axis wind turbine is higher than horizontal axis wind turbine  
- Cut-in speed is same for both vertical and horizontal axis wind turbines  
- Cut-in speed is always higher than the cut-off speed of a turbine

**Solution:**  
Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) are designed to capture wind more efficiently at lower speeds. In contrast, Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) typically require a higher minimum wind speed (cut-in speed) to start operating.  

**Correct Answer:** **Cut-in speed for vertical axis wind turbine is higher than horizontal axis wind turbine**

## Question 3

**Which of the following is the correct definition of a Net-Zero-Energy building?**

**Options:**
- Produced energy = Consumed energy (calculated daily)  
- Produced energy = Consumed energy (calculated hourly)  
- Produced energy = Consumed energy (calculated monthly)  
- Produced energy = Consumed energy (calculated annually)

**Solution:**  
A Net-Zero-Energy building is one in which the total energy produced on-site equals the total energy consumed over a one-year period.  

**Correct Answer:** **Produced energy = Consumed energy (calculated annually)**

## Question 4

**A building with an area of 6,000 square meters consumes 1,650,000 kWh of electricity annually. What is the EPI of this building? Assuming the building is in a Warm & Humid climate zone, what type of building can this be?**  
*(Select two answers.)*

**Options:**
- 275 kWh/sq.m per year  
- Residence  
- 25.5 kWh/sf per year  
- Hospitals

**Solution:**  
1. **EPI Calculation:**  
   \[
   \text{EPI} = \frac{1,650,000 \text{ kWh}}{6000 \text{ m}^2} = 275 \text{ kWh/m}^2\text{/year}
   \]
2. **Conversion to kWh/sf:**  
   \[
   275 \text{ kWh/m}^2 \approx 25.5 \text{ kWh/sf/year}
   \]
3. **Building Type:**  
   Based on the Energy Benchmarks for Commercial Buildings (BEE India) for a Warm & Humid climate, an EPI of 275 kWh/m²/year (or 25.5 kWh/sf/year) is typically associated with **Hospitals** rather than residences.

**Correct Answers:** **275 kWh/sq.m per year** and **Hospitals**

## Question 5

**Which of the following statements are correct about site energy? Select two.**

**Options:**
- The quantity of energy that gets metered and reported in our electricity bill is called site energy.  
- The energy we consume within the site boundary is called site energy.  
- Site-energy does not include the energy from fuels that we burn on-site, such as our cooking gas.  
- The energy that we produce on site is called site energy.

**Solution:**  
- **Statement 1:** Correct – it describes the metered energy on an electricity bill.  
- **Statement 2:** Correct – it defines the energy consumption within the site boundaries.  
- **Statements 3 and 4** are not accurate definitions for site energy.

**Correct Answers:**  
- The quantity of energy that gets metered and reported in our electricity bill is called site energy.  
- The energy we consume within the site boundary is called site energy.

## Question 6

**Which are valid climate zones as per ECBC? Select two.**

**Options:**
- Warm & Humid  
- Hot & Dry  
- Hot & Humid  
- Cold & Dry

**Solution:**  
The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) typically categorizes climates as:  
- **Warm & Humid**  
- **Hot & Dry**

**Correct Answers:** **Warm & Humid** and **Hot & Dry**

## Question 7

**A building with a floor area of 200 sq.m has the following renewable energy generation options:**

- 3 kW solar PV panels  
- 2 kW rating wind turbine (capacity factor = 18%)  
- 500 kg of biomass available in a year (furnace efficiency = 90%)

**Choose the correct target Energy Use Intensity (EUI) for net-zero performance if all the options were used on site.**

**Options:**
- 32 kWh/sq.m.year  
- 84 kWh/sq.m.year  
- 72 kWh/sq.m.year  
- 54 kWh/sq.m.year

**Solution:**  

1. **Solar PV Calculation:**  
   \[
   3 \text{ kW} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 365 \approx 5475 \text{ kWh/year}
   \]
2. **Wind Turbine Calculation:**  
   \[
   2 \text{ kW} \times 8760 \text{ hours/year} \times 0.18 \approx 3154 \text{ kWh/year}
   \]
3. **Biomass Calculation:**  
   Assuming an energy content of approximately 4 kWh/kg,  
   \[
   500 \text{ kg} \times 4 \times 0.9 \approx 1800 \text{ kWh/year}
   \]
4. **Total Renewable Energy Production:**  
   \[
   5475 + 3154 + 1800 \approx 10,429 \text{ kWh/year}
   \]
5. **Target EUI Calculation:**  
   \[
   \text{Target EUI} = \frac{10,429 \text{ kWh/year}}{200 \text{ m}^2} \approx 52.1 \text{ kWh/m}^2\text{/year}
   \]
   The closest option is **54 kWh/sq.m.year**.

**Correct Answer:** **54 kWh/sq.m.year**

## Question 8

**A single-family home in India has an average daily energy consumption of 8 kWh. The household is equipped with a solar panel system that generates an average of 4 kWh per day. The household is to be connected to a battery to store excess energy, and the battery will have an efficiency of 80%. What should the size of the battery be to ensure that the household has enough energy for two days, if there was no energy input from the grid, but the solar panel system continued to provide energy as usual?**

**Options:**
- 16 kWh  
- 8 kWh  
- 10 kWh  
- 20 kWh

**Solution:**  

1. **Two-Day Energy Consumption:**  
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ kWh}
   \]
2. **Solar Contribution in Two Days:**  
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ kWh}
   \]
3. **Energy Shortfall:**  
   \[
   16 - 8 = 8 \text{ kWh}
   \]
4. **Accounting for Battery Efficiency (80%):**  
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ kWh}}{0.8} = 10 \text{ kWh}
   \]

**Correct Answer:** **10 kWh**

## Question 9

**The energy use intensity of a 1,000 m² building is 90 kWh/sq.m.year. What is the total capacity of a PV array needed to achieve net-zero energy performance?**

**Options:**
- 90,000 kW  
- 90 kW  
- 60 kW  
- 60,000 kW

**Solution:**  

1. **Total Annual Energy Consumption:**  
   \[
   90 \text{ kWh/m}^2\text{/year} \times 1000 \text{ m}^2 = 90,000 \text{ kWh/year}
   \]
2. **PV Array Capacity Calculation:**  
   Assuming a PV yield of approximately 1500 kWh per kW per year,  
   \[
   \frac{90,000 \text{ kWh/year}}{1500 \text{ kWh/kW/year}} = 60 \text{ kW}
   \]

**Correct Answer:** **60 kW**
